# DS_Disertation

### This is the acumilation of all the relevent code files for the running of the Neural Turing machine (NTM) and the Lie Access Neural Turing machine (LANTM).
### This paper has managed to get the NTM to work, but has had difficulties with getting the LANTM working.
### To run the models use the model_train files for the NTM and LANTM respectivly. If further study of the two machines is wanted, it is possible to enter the repective directories where you can study the overall set up of the machine and see the differen models containing the controller, heads and memory.
